LuoguHaskell - a project dedicated to programming with Haskell on the Luogu Online Judge

**LuoguHaskell** is a project dedicated to programming with Haskell on the Luogu Online Judge (Luogu) platform. Most code in this project is translated from c/c++ by chatgpt. Its goal is to provide Haskell enthusiasts and competitive programmers with an elegant way to solve problems, improving the program logic. The project includes a series of example code, and tools for using Haskell on Luogu.

## Features

- **Luogu Problem Examples:** Provides Haskell solution examples for common Luogu problems, covering various levels of difficulty and types of challenges to help you get started quickly.
- **Code Templates and Tools:** Supplies generic Haskell code templates and potentially useful tools and libraries for competitive programming and problem solving.
- **Community Support:** Encourages developers to share their problem-solving approaches and experiences. Engage in discussions, ask questions, and offer insights via GitHub Discussions or Issues to contribute to the project's growth.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository or download the ZIP file.
2. Follow the environment setup guide in the documentation to configure your Haskell environment according to the provided steps.
3. Explore the example code to understand how to solve different types of Luogu problems using Haskell.
4. Use the provided code templates as needed to write your own solutions.
5. If you encounter issues, seek help in GitHub Discussions or submit an Issue for assistance.

## How to Contribute

We welcome your contributions! If you are interested in Haskell and Luogu programming, you can:

- Share your problem-solving approaches and code examples.
